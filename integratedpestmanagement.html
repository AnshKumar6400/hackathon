                    Integrated Pest Management (IPM) is an effective and environmentally sensitive approach to pest 
                    management that relies on a combination of common-sense practices. IPM programs use current, 
                    comprehensive information on the lifecycles of pests and their interaction with the environment.
                    This information, in combination with available pest control methods, is used to manage pest
                    damage by the most economical means, and with the least possible hazard topeople, property,
                    and the environment.

                    The IPM approach can be applied to both agricultural and non-agricultural settings, such as the
                     home, garden, and workplace. IPM takes advantage of all appropriate pest management options 
                     including, but not limited to, the judicioususe of pesticides. In contrast, organic food 
                    production applies many of the same concepts as IPM but limits the use ofpesticides to those
                    that are produced from natural sources, as opposed to synthetic chemicals.

                IPM is not a single pest control method but, rather, a series of pest management evaluations, decisions and controls. 
                In practicing IPM, growers who are aware of the potential for pest infestation follow a four-tiered approach. 
                The four steps include:

                Set Action Thresholds
                Before taking any pest control action, IPM first sets an action threshold, a point at which pest populations or
                 environmental conditionsindicate that pest control action must be taken. Sighting a single pest does not always
                mean control is needed. The level at which pestswill become an economic threat is critical to guide future pest 
                control decisions.
 
                Monitor and Identify Pests
                Not all insects, weeds, and other living organisms require control. Many organisms are innocuous, and some are even
                 beneficial. IPM programswork to monitor for pests and identify them accurately, so that appropriate control decisions 
                can be made in conjunction with action thresholds.This monitoring and identification removes the possibility that
                pesticides will be used when they are not really needed or that the wrong kind of pesticide will be used.

                Prevention
                As a first line of pest control, IPM programs work to manage the crop, lawn, or indoor space to prevent pests from
                 becoming a threat.In an agricultural crop, this may mean using cultural methods, such as rotating between different 
                 crops, selecting pest-resistant varieties, and planting pest-free rootstock. These control methods can be very
                 effective and cost-efficient and present little to no risk to people or the environment.

                Control
                Once monitoring, identification, and action thresholds indicate that pest control is required, and preventive 
                methods are no longereffective or available, IPM programs then evaluate the proper control method both for 
                effectiveness and risk. Effective, less risky pest controls are chosen first, including highly targeted chemicals,
                 such as pheromones to disrupt pest mating, or mechanical control,such as trapping or weeding. If further monitoring, 
                identifications and action thresholds indicate that less risky controls are notworking, then additional pest control
                methods would be employed, such as targeted spraying of pesticides. Broadcast spraying of non-specific pesticides is
                 a last resort. <br><br>

                IPM is the selection and [16] use of pest control actions that will ensure favourable economic condition, ecological and social 
                consequences[17] and is applicable to most agricultural, public health and amenity pest management situations. The IPM process
                 starts with monitoring, which includes inspection and identification, followed by the establishment of economic injury levels.
                  The economic injury levels set the economic threshold level. That is the point when pest damage (and the benefits of treating 
                  the pest) exceed the cost of treatment.[18] This can also be an action threshold level for determining an unacceptable level
                   that is not tied to economic injury.
