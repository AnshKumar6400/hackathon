                    Conservation Agriculture (CA) is a sustainable approach to agricultural production which aims to protect soil from erosion and degradation, improve its quality and biodiversity, 
                    contribute to the preservation of natural resources, water and air, whilst optimising yields.
                    CA is based on three core principles: minimum soil disturbance, maintenance of permanent soil cover and use of crop rotations with a diversity of crop species.
                    Related concepts include no tillage and groundcovers as a way of minimising soil disturbance.
                    Economic benefits of the approach include labour and fuel saving in perennial crops, cost-savings in annual crops, increase of yields, reduction of run-off and erosion which 
                    contribute to increased agricultural production costs.
                    Environmental benefits include: improvement of soil properties, increase of biodiversity, less erosion, less CO2 emissions, increased carbon sequestration, less contamination 
                    of downstream water, reduction of floods and landslides.

                Conservation agriculture is largely the product of the collective efforts of a number of previous agricultural movements, including no-till agriculture, agroforestry,
                 green manures/cover crops,direct planting/seeding, integrated pest management, and conservation tillage among many others. Yet CA is distinct from each of these 
                 so-called agricultural packages, even as it draws upon many of their core principles. This is because CA uses many of the available technologies in unison,
                  resulting in something many believe to be much greater than the "sum of its parts."

                Conservation agriculture is based on the interrelated principles of minimal mechanical soil disturbance, permanent soil cover with living or dead plant material, and crop diversification
                through rotation or intercropping. It helps farmers to maintain and boost yields and increase profits, while reversing land degradation, protecting the environment and responding to
                growing challenges of climate change.To reduce soil disturbance, farmers practice zero-tillage farming, which allows direct planting without plowing or preparing the soil. The farmer 
                seeds directly through surface residues of the previous crop.
                Zero tillage is combined with intercropping and crop rotation, which means either growing two or more crops at the same time on the same piece of land, or growing two different crops 
                on the same land in a sequential manner. These are also core principles of sustainable intensification.
