                    Precision farming is an approach where inputs are utilised in precise amounts to get increased average yields, compared to traditional cultivation techniques. 
                    In India, one major problem is the small field size. More than 58 per cent of operational holdings in the country have size less than one hectare (ha).

                Why precision farming

                To increase agriculture productivity
                Prevents soil degradation
                Reduction of chemical application in crop production
                Efficient use of water resources
                Dissemination of modern farm practices to improve quality, quantity and reduced cost of production
                Developing favourable attitudes
                Precision farming changing the socio-economic status of farmers
                Advantages 

                Agronomical perspective 
                Technical perspective
                Environmental perspective
                Economic perspective

                Precision agriculture has also been enabled by unmanned aerial vehicles that are relatively inexpensive and can be operated by novice pilots. These agricultural 
                drones can be equipped with multispectral or RGB cameras to capture many images of a field that can be stitched together using photogrammetric methods to create 
                orthophotos. These multispectral images contain multiple values per pixel in addition to the traditional red, green blue values such as near infrared and red-edge 
                spectrum values used to process and analyze vegetative indexes such as NDVI maps


                Precision agriculture is a key component of the third wave of modern agricultural revolutions. The first agricultural revolution was the increase of mechanized 
                agriculture, from 1900 to 1930. Each farmer produced enough food to feed about 26 people during this time.[15] The 1960s prompted the Green Revolution with new methods 
                of genetic modification, which led to each farmer feeding about 156 people.[15] It is expected that by 2050, the global population will reach about 9.6 billion, and 
                food production must effectively double from current levels in order to feed every mouth. With new technological advancements in the agricultural revolution of precision 
                farming, each farmer will be able to feed 265 people on the same acreage.[15]
