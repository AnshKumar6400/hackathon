                    Crop rotation is the practice of planting different crops sequentially on the same plot of land to improve soil health, optimize nutrients in the soil, and combat pest and weed pressure.

                    For example, say a farmer has planted a field of corn. When the corn harvest is finished, he might plant beans, since corn consumes a lot of nitrogen and beans return nitrogen to the soil.
                    
                    A simple rotation might involve two or three crops, and complex rotations might incorporate a dozen or more.

                Crop rotation helps return nutrients to the soil without synthetic inputs.

                The practice also works to interrupt pest and disease cycles, improve soil health by increasing biomass from different cropsâ€™ root structures, and increase biodiversity on the farm. 
                Life in the soil thrives on variety, and beneficial insects and pollinators are attracted to the variety above ground, too.

                Crop choice is often related to the goal the farmer is looking to achieve with the rotation, which could be weed management, increasing available nitrogen in the soil, controlling 
                for erosion, or increasing soil structure and biomass, to name a few.[5] When discussing crop rotations, crops are classified in different ways depending on what quality is
                 being assessed: by family, by nutrient needs/benefits, and/or by profitability (i.e. cash crop versus cover crop).[6] For example, giving adequate attention to plant family 
                 is essential to mitigating pests and pathogens. However, many farmers have success managing rotations by planning sequencing and cover crops around desirable cash crops.[7]
                  The following is a simplified classification based on crop quality and purpose.

                Many crops which are critical for the market, like vegetables, are row crops (that is, grown in tight rows).[6] While often the most profitable for farmers, these crops are
                 more taxing on the soil.[6] Row crops typically have low biomass and shallow roots: this means the plant contributes low residue to the surrounding soil and has limited effects 
                 on structure.[8] With much of the soil around the plant exposed to disruption by rainfall and traffic, fields with row crops experience faster break down of organic matter by microbes, leaving fewer nutrients for future plants.[8]

                 In short, while these crops may be profitable for the farm, they are nutrient depleting. Crop rotation practices exist to strike a balance between short-term profitability and long-term productivity.[7]
