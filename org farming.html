                Organic farming can be defined as a system of management and agricultural production that 
                combines a high level of biodiversity with environmental practices that preserve natural resources and has 
                rigorous standards for animal welfare. Furthermore, organic farming responds to consumer growing demand for 
                natural products and simultaneously allows to preserve the environment in the context of sustainable rural
                development.  The term organic farming can apply to the following categories of products:

                Unprocessed products: vegetables, cereals, fruits, cotton, flowers, animals, eggs or milk;
                Processed products for human consumption: cheese, bread or instantaneous meals;
                Food for animals like organic soy cakes;
                Materials for vegetative reproduction and seeds.</strong><br><br>

                Organic farming can be beneficial on biodiversity and environmental protection at local level.
                However, because organic farming has lower yields compared to conventional farming, additional 
                agricultural land is needed elsewhere in the world, which means that natural land has to be converted 
                into agricultural land. This can cause loss of biodiversity and negative climate effects that outweigh the
                local environmental gains achieved.

                Organic farming methods
                <strong>Fertilizers</strong>
                Since synthetic fertilizers are not used, building and maintaining a rich, living soil through the addition 
                of organic matter is a priority for organic farmers. Organic matter can be applied through the application of 
                manure, compost, and animal by-products, such as feather meal or blood meal. Due to the potential for harbouring 
                human pathogens, the USDA National Organic Standards mandate that raw manure must be applied no later than 90 or 
                120 days before harvest, depending on whether the harvested part of the crop is in contact with the ground. 
                Composted manure that has been turned 5 times in 15 days and reached temperatures between 55–77.2 °C (131–171 °F)
                 has no restrictions on application times. Compost adds organic matter, providing a wide range of nutrients for 
                 plants, and adds beneficial microbes to the soil. Given that these nutrients are mostly in an unmineralized form 
                 that cannot be taken up by plants, soil microbes are needed to break down organic matter and transform nutrients 
                 into a bioavailable “mineralized” state. In comparison, synthetic fertilizers are already in mineralized form and 
                 can be taken up by plants directly.

                Soil is maintained by planting and then tilling in cover crops, which help protect the soil from erosion off-season 
                and provide additional organic matter. The tilling in of nitrogen-fixing cover crops, such as clover or alfalfa, also 
                adds nitrogen to the soil. Cover crops are commonly planted before or after the cash crop season or in conjunction with 
                crop rotation and can also be planted between the rows of some crops, such as tree fruits. Researchers and growers are 
                working to develop organic farming “no-till” and reduced-tillage practices in order to further reduce erosion.

                <strong>Pest control</strong>  
               Organic pesticides are derived from naturally occurring sources. These include living organisms such as the bacteria Bacillus 
               thuringiensis, which is used to control caterpillar pests, or plant derivatives such as pyrethrins (from the dried flower heads 
               of Chrysanthemum cinerariifolium) or neem oil (from the seeds of Azadirachta indica). Mineral-based inorganic pesticides such 
               as sulfur and copper are also allowed.

                In addition to pesticides, organic pest control integrates biological, cultural, and genetic controls to minimize pest damage.
                Biological control utilizes the natural enemies of pests, such as predatory insects (e.g., ladybugs) or parasitoids (e.g., certain wasps) 
                to attack insect pests. Pest cycles can be disrupted with cultural controls, of which crop rotation is the most widely used. Finally, 
                traditional plant breeding has produced numerous crop varieties that are resistant to specific pests. The use of such varieties and the 
                planting of genetically diverse crops provide genetic control against pests and many plant diseases.
